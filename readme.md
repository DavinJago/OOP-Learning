## Object-Oriented Programming Learning

In Semester 2, I studied Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) as part of the curriculum, since it is one of the mandatory courses and also one of the graduation requirements. This course carries 4 credit units (SKS) and is conducted over a full semester under the supervision of the assigned lecturer.

Object-Oriented Programming is one of the most important concepts in modern software development. It focuses on organizing programs around objects rather than solely relying on functions or procedural logic. By using OOP, developers can structure their code in a more modular, reusable, and maintainable way.

OOP is built upon several core principles, namely:

- **Encapsulation** – grouping data and methods into a single unit (class) and controlling access to them.  
- **Abstraction** – exposing only essential features while hiding implementation details.  
- **Inheritance** – allowing a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class.  
- **Polymorphism** – enabling objects to be treated as instances of their parent class while behaving differently based on their actual implementation.

Through this course, I learned how to design programs using classes and objects, define attributes and methods, and implement relationships between classes. The learning process also emphasized problem-solving skills by translating real-world scenarios into object-oriented models.

Throughout the semester, practical exercises and assignments were provided to strengthen understanding, ranging from basic class creation to more advanced topics such as constructors, access modifiers, inheritance hierarchies, and simple project implementations. These activities helped bridge theoretical concepts with real coding practices.

The main goal of studying OOP is to develop the ability to write clean, structured, and scalable code. By applying object-oriented principles, programs become easier to understand, extend, and debug, especially as project complexity increases.

This repository serves as a learning log and practice space for my OOP journey. It contains source code examples, exercises, and notes that document my progress and understanding of Object-Oriented Programming concepts during Semester 2.
