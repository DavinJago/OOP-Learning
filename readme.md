## Object-Oriented Programming Learning

In Semester 2, I studied Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) as part of the curriculum, since it is one of the mandatory courses and also one of the graduation requirements. This course carries 4 credit units (SKS) and is conducted over a full semester under the supervision of the assigned lecturer.

Object-Oriented Programming is one of the most important concepts in modern software development. It focuses on organizing programs around objects rather than solely relying on functions or procedural logic. By using OOP, developers can structure their code in a more modular, reusable, and maintainable way.

OOP is built upon several core principles, namely:

- **Encapsulation** – grouping data and methods into a single unit (class) and controlling access to them.  
- **Abstraction** – exposing only essential features while hiding implementation details.  
- **Inheritance** – allowing a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class.  
- **Polymorphism** – enabling objects to be treated as instances of their parent class while behaving differently based on their actual implementation.

The main goal of studying OOP is to develop the ability to write clean, structured, and scalable code. By applying object-oriented principles, programs become easier to understand, extend, and debug, especially as project complexity increases.
