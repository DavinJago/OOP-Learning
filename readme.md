In Semester 2, I studied Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) as part of the curriculum, since it is one of the mandatory courses and also one of the graduation requirements. This course carries 4 credit units (SKS) and is conducted over a full semester under the supervision of the assigned lecturer.

OOP is built upon several core principles, namely:

- **Encapsulation** – grouping data and methods into a single unit (class) and controlling access to them.  
- **Abstraction** – exposing only essential features while hiding implementation details.  
- **Inheritance** – allowing a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class.  
- **Polymorphism** – enabling objects to be treated as instances of their parent class while behaving differently based on their actual implementation.

The main goal of studying OOP is to develop the ability to write clean, structured, and scalable code. By applying object-oriented principles, programs become easier to understand, extend, and debug, especially as project complexity increases.
