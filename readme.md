In Semester 2, I studied Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) as part of the curriculum, since it is one of the mandatory courses and also one of the graduation requirements. This course carries 4 credit units (SKS) and is conducted over a full semester under the supervision of the assigned lecturer.

Due to the broad range of topics covered and the fact that I did not fully grasp many OOP concepts at the time, I decided to revisit and relearn the material independently. This repository documents my learning process and my efforts to strengthen my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming.

OOP is built upon several core principles, namely:

- **Abstraction** – exposing only essential features while hiding implementation details. 
- **Encapsulation** – grouping data and methods into a single unit (class) and controlling access to them.  
- **Inheritance** – allowing a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class.  
- **Polymorphism** – enabling objects to be treated as instances of their parent class while behaving differently based on their actual implementation.

> The main goal of studying OOP is to develop the ability to write clean, structured, and scalable code. By applying object-oriented principles, programs become easier to understand, extend, and debug, especially as project complexity increases.
