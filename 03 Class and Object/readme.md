## What I Learned 

### OOP Structures

* Dictionary
* Module
* Library

Examples:

* Dictionary -> Key Value
- Sarah : Human, Food : Burgers
* Module -> main program TO many program
* Library -> stdio.h, conio.h

Notes:

* this is the prefix slides of class \& object
* the main 3 usually used on oop
* Package, class, method is commonly used in oop

### Class

* input -> process -> output commonly used
* A program is made up of many cooperating objects
* So the class is the main function with object

### Object

* Object is a code and independence data
* key of object is break down problems into smaller, easier to understand pieces
* Object is made and used

Examples:

* String
* Integer
* Dictionary
* List

Definition:

* class - template
* method - specified class abilities
* attribute - data in such class
* object - A particular instance of a class

Notes:

* so basically class contain methods and attributes, and produce objects.
* class implementation -> class.py

### Method
* Function : Function call is standalone, not attached to an object
* Methods : must be called through an object
* function that affiliate to class is called method.

Example:

functions -> print(), input()
methods -> filename  = "club.txt"

### Constructor
* Used for initiation object condition
* similar to method, filled with instruction
* executed immediately after object used

Notes :
* Constructor always using __init__
* different from method, const using obj to execute
* obj aims to automatic execute
