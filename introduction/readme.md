# What I Learned (Introduction Slides)

### Computer Compilation Process

* Input -> Program -> Compiler -> Linker -> Execution
* Lecturer Explaining the Harddisk & Computer

### Compiler Design

* Programming is divided by 4
* Logic
* Language
* Compiler
* Paradigm

Definition:

* Logic -> Essential soft skills Every programmer needed
* Language -> Many language has created, ex fortran, etc
* Compiler -> Source code > Compiler > Object Code
* Compiler himself divided again to LLVM, VM, JVW, etc

### Programming Paradigms
Divided by 2, Imperative & Declarative
Imperative focusing to HOW TO DO
Declarative focusing to WHAT to achieve

Imperative :
* Object-Oriented Programming
* Procedural Programming
* Parallel Processing Approach

Declarative :
* Functional Programming
* Logical Programming
* Database Processing Approach

> There are many examples of paradigms, such as EDP, Procedural Programming, Imperative, etc.

## Object Oriented Programming vs Functional Programming

### Object Oriented
OOP is a paradigm based on a object concept, it was inheritance from class that summarize data and method.
OOP is a popular paradigm, used for many app, such as dekstop software and mobile, video games, and web development

### Functional Programming  
* Paradigm that based on function concept on math
* Function treated like object class 1, function can be forwarded to another function
* FP emphasize on data which cannot be changed and avoiding side effect (Input/Output)

## OOP
* Like its name, OOP using object for programming
* OOP aiming to implement real life entity like abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.
* The main purpose of OOP is to bind the data to function so no other parts of another code can acsess this function
> except this function exist

OOP Concepts
> Abstraction, Inherintance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Class, Object.
